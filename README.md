# Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project is a Python application that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points, A and B, on a graph. The graph consists of nodes representing locations and edges representing connections between these locations.

## Introduction

This application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes on a graph. Nodes represent locations, and edges between nodes represent connections or paths between these locations. The algorithm calculates the shortest path by considering edge weights, and it can be used in various scenarios, such as navigation systems or network routing.

## Features

- Visualization of the graph with nodes and edges.
- Interactive user interface using tkinter.
- Adjustable difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.
- Calculates the shortest path considering different edge weights based on the difficulty level.
- Displays estimated time of travel and distance for the shortest path.

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/uvsq22104322/GPS_Courchevel.git
```

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the Python script:
```
python main.py
``` 
2. The application window will open, displaying a map with nodes representing locations and edges representing connections between them.

3. Check the boxes for displaying nodes, edges, and background image as desired.

4. Select the difficulty level from the dropdown menu.

5. Click on two nodes to find the shortest path between them. The application will display the estimated time of travel, distance, and the path taken.
